The birthday problem is to find the probability that, in a group of N people, there is at least one pair of people who have the same birthday.
For simplicity, disregard variations in the distribution, such as leap years, twins, seasonal or weekday variations, and assume that the 365 possible birthdays are equally likely.
Therefore probability of a given birthday for a person chosen from the entire population at random is 1/365.

No of people	Probability

5		0.0400
10		0.1600
15		0.2600
20		0.4000
25		0.5000
30		0.7100
35		0.8300
40		0.9200
45		0.9600
50		0.9400
55		0.9800
60		0.9900
65		1.0000
70		1.0000
75		1.0000
80		1.0000

Hence we see that the probability increases as the no of people increases.
At 23 it becomes 50% and after 57 it becomes constant i.e. 100%.
This proves that Birthday Paradox is indeed correct!
